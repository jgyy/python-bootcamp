2021 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python.

## Notes

This repository is meant as my python relearning journey after 1 year of inactivity. By default jupyter notebook will not be used unless i need to present my code for interview.

## Launching Jupyter Notebook App

The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

```sh
jupyter notebook
```
